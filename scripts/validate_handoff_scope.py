"""Advisory (warn-only) Harness handoff ownership gate.

Every handoff has one owner. This repository-local gate is intentionally
independent of the operations workspace so a CI runner can validate the exact
bytes destined for Harness without importing another repository or installing
a dependency.

This is a PORT of the SCMessenger gate (scripts/validate_handoff_scope.py
there), adapted to Harness policy. It is ADVISORY: findings are reported as
warnings and the process exits 0 on document content. It never fails a build
on a handoff document. The --self-test mode is strict (it tests the tool
itself, not documents) and fails if the classifier drifts.

The gate reports missing, altered, duplicated, or fenced scope metadata and
any foreign-repository alias in the rest of the document. A per-document
waiver register (handoff_scope_waivers.json at the repository root) gives
documents that cannot honestly carry `foreign_material: NONE` a compliant
form: a waiver suppresses the warning for exactly one named document without
writing a byte into it. It also provides --staged (which reads the Git index,
not the mutable worktree) and --changed-from (CI) modes.

# Waivers.
#
# A waiver is a named, dated, owner-signed exception for ONE document. It is
# deliberately NOT a way to assert ownership: a waiver suppresses enforcement
# without writing a single byte into the document, so a waived document is
# never stamped with metadata it does not earn.
#
# The register is a data file so that "which documents are exempt, and who
# signed for each" is auditable by reading one file and running one command,
# rather than by reading the gate's source for hardcoded exceptions.
#
# Three properties keep this from becoming a quiet hole:
#   * fail-closed parsing -- a malformed register is a gate FAILURE, never a
#     silently empty one;
#   * no dead entries -- a waiver naming a path that is not a tracked handoff
#     document is a failure, so a typo cannot look like a working waiver;
#   * no stale entries -- a waiver whose document no longer trips the alias
#     detector is a failure, so an exemption cannot outlive its reason.
